# MUD Todo List Example

This example project demonstrates how to use the MUD framework to create a simple todo list application.

## Getting started

1. Since this project uses local MUD dependencies, you need to prepare them first by running this command in the MUD root directory: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
2. To start the development environment of this project, run `pnpm dev` in the project root. This will start a local chain, deploy the contracts in `packages/contracts`, and start a development server for the client.
3. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
